## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Performed

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Import**
- Imported CSV data into MySQL.
- Converted `order_date` from `DD/MM/YYYY` format to proper `DATE` type.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Use `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date)` for Month**
- **Purpose:** Extracts month from `order_date` to analyze monthly patterns.
- **Expected Output:** A list showing month numbers (1‚Äì12) for each record.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Group Data by Year and Month**
- **Purpose:** Groups sales records by year and month for aggregation.
- **Expected Output:** Each row represents a unique `(year, month)` combination.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Use `SUM()` for Revenue**
- **Purpose:** Calculates total revenue for each month.
- **Expected Output:** Table with `year`, `month`, and total monthly revenue.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Use `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)` for Volume**
- **Purpose:** Counts unique orders per month.
- **Expected Output:** Table showing number of distinct orders for each month.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Use `ORDER BY` for Sorting**
- **Purpose:** Sorts results in chronological order or by highest revenue.
- **Expected Output:** Ordered list of months either ascending or descending.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Limit Results for Specific Time Periods**
- **Purpose:** Filters sales data for a chosen date range (e.g., Mar‚ÄìJun 2024).
- **Expected Output:** Only months within that period, with corresponding revenue and volume.

---

## üìà Insights from the Analysis
- üí∞ **Revenue Trends:** Identified peak months for earnings.
- üì¶ **Order Volumes:** Found months with highest order counts.
- üóìÔ∏è **Seasonal Insights:** Filtered and compared specific time periods.
